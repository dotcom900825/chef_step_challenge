        I have been thinking about if we can build a tiny sensor that we can embedded in every parking spot, and the user can see those stat to help them reduce the time they spend on finding a parking spot. In UCSD, this has been a major issues due to limited parking slots and a rapidly growing enrolled students. $1M might be enough to have me and another hardware engineer to spin off the project, we can travel to Shenzhen where we can easy percure hardware components and have a lower living cost then in California, is enough for us to hire a couple more engineers and build the prototype.
